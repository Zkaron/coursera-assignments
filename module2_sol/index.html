			<header>Theory 1. Snake vs Crane.</header>
		    The origin of tai chi may in fact spring from the Wudang mountains in the 12th century. Some hold that the Taoist sage Chang San Feng was there when he happened to observe a deadly fight between a snake and the crane. The crane attacked, stabbing and jabbing at the snake. Somehow, the snake managed to evade. The snake fought back with whip-like attacks of its own. But, the crane deflected these attacks by fiercely spreading its wings.

			<header>Theory 2. A Mysterious Stranger Brings Tai Chi to the Chen Village.</header>
		    Tai chi was passed down to Wang Tsung Yueh, a mysterious stranger who travelled to the Chen village. While at the local inn, he let loose with a string of insults about the villageâ€™s martial arts. The Chen villagers responded accordingly and fiercely attacked Wang.

            Although outnumbered, Wang was the clear victor. The next day, he became the official Chen village martial arts teacher. Wang taught the villagers how to modify their Shaolin-like martial art with the internal principles of his style.

			<header>Theory 3. A Seasoned Chen Fighter Creates Tai Chi.</header>
			Others argue that tai chi was created in the Chen village by a Chen warrior. The headman Chen Wan Ting (1600-1680) had mastered numerous martial arts techniques while serving as a general in the Chinese army. He combined the best aspects from various combat styles he had learned, then added components from Chinese medicine and the acupuncture meridian system to create a tai chi fighing style to protect his village.

            The martial applications of tai chi--with underlying Chinese medicine principles and some internal Taoist practices was known, thriving, and also well-guarded in the Chen village by the 17th Century.
